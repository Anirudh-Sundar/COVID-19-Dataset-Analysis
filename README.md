# COVID-19-Dataset-Analysis

### :busts_in_silhouette: Description
* Objective of the research is to perform a analysis of the COVID-19 dataset. From the analysis we intend to gather research articles based on their subject (which is represented by the abstract).
* This analysis is performed by clustering the sentence embeddings and optimizing them by using a Genetic Algorithm.

### :cd: Dataset
* COVID-19 Dataset :

### :key: Run the Code
* Use the sample video given and run Isolation.ipynb with it.
* The output will be a black and white video, run Prediction.ipynb with it by changing the video path. 
* Prediction.ipynb will yield a result in the form of an interpolation graph.

  
### :books: Libraries Used
